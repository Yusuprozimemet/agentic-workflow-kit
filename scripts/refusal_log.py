"""Every refusal a guard makes, one JSON line each, so the dashboard can count them.

    python scripts/refusal_log.py     # print the counts per date and guard from this machine's log

step-guard.py, read-guard.py and auditor-guard.py call record() each time they refuse (exit 2). The
log is .claude/state/refusals.jsonl in the project, gitignored: it holds local paths and session ids.
token-usage.py, run at every close, writes counts() into docs/dashboard/refusals.json, which is
committed; the dashboard's "Hooks at work" table shows it. Only what the counts need goes there:
date, guard and number. A refusal is the rule working, but many of one kind say the rule is read past
or is in the way: the counts are there to tell which.

record() never raises: a guard that fails to log still refuses. GUARD_REFUSAL_LOG names another log
file, so the guards' tests do not write into the repository's own.
