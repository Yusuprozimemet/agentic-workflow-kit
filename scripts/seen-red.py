"""Run the branch's tests on the code as it was before the day, and print the `seen red:` line.

    python scripts/seen-red.py [--base main] -- <command> [args...]

A `new` check must fail on the code before the change (specs/README.md). This makes that run
mechanical: it checks the base out into a scratch git worktree, copies in every file under tests/
(or a tests.py at the root) that differs from the base in the working tree (committed or not,
untracked included), except the paths the project file's `code_under_tests` names (code a test
checks that lives under tests/, such as a fixture builder), and runs the command there, as an
argument list with no shell. Nothing in the working tree is touched.

It exits 0 only when the command failed there, and prints the record for the PR:
`seen red: <command> on <base> → <what it reported>`. A command that passes on the base exits 1:
the tests do not see the change. Read the reported line: `errors=` alone may be an import error,
not the behaviour the test asserts.

The step was a Note, not a script, and did not carry: a pilot of the kit merged two tracks whose new
tests were never seen red on the code before them.
